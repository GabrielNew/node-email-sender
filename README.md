# E-mail sender with Nodejs and Nodemailer

this is a simple script, made with Nodejs and the nodemailer package. With this code you can send a email and an attachment file on the message.

## Configuration

You may run this script putting all data like email and password directly on the code but, if you need to secure your data it's better to create a file called ".env". This file should be on the root of the folder "email-sender".
If you want to use gmail, you'll need to configure auth on the email sender.

## Build with

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) - Open source server environment
* [Nodemailer](https://www.nodemailer.com/) - Module for Node.js applications that allows easy email sending
